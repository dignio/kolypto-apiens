""" Date and time in UTC, represented as RFC 3339 datetime string.

NOTE: It's always in UTC. The timezone suffix is added for convenience, but it always points to UTC.

NOTE: RFC 3339 differs from ISO 8601 in that it allows the use of space " " separator
between the date and the time parts. It also supports the "Z" suffix that indicates UTC offset of zero.
